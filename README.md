# WC-REST-Dashboard
A dashboard and notifications system for WooCommerce stores.

The WooCommerce REST Dashboard is designed to help retailers that are using WooCommerce with their backoffice operations. This application polls WooCommerce for updated information about Customers, Orders and Products.

The first release will be focused primarily around warehousing, with the feature set including near realtime (polled) updates to orders, notifications of new orders (in-browser and desktop native notifications), auto-printing of pick lists and packing slips and simple reporting on time-to-pack and time-to-ship for orders.
